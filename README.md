# rpiairsensor

This is a prototype air sensor which monitors 
         - Temperature
         - Humidity
         - Air quality ( index and some gas levels CO2, CO etc )
         - Dust sensor 
        
        
DH22 sensor is used for Temperature and Humidity. MQ135 sensor is hooked via MCP3008 ( A2D convertor) to monitor certain pollutant gases. Currently only an index (dac value) and CO2 are computed. Similarly the  Sharpâ€™s GP2Y1010AU0F infrared dust and haze sensor is used to approximate the PM matter in the air. These are interefaced with Raspberry Pi 2/2+/3. MQ135 and GP2Y1010AU0F are analog sensors and needs interfacing with MCP3008 and approximate algorithm using the datasheet to determine the pollutant factors. DHT22 give digal output which can be directly read.

This is a project proposed by me and my colleagues to be submitted in our Science Exhibition at Harvest International School, Bangalore. The prototype is constructed on breadboards and the sensor data is logged into a MYSQL database. A frontend Apache webpage display the raw data and charts the above sensor values using Google chart.
The future scope is to link all such sensors spread across cities and other school on to a common platform and provide an overall geographic heatmap of the pollution around us. A front end APP will collate all these sensor node(s) readings and present it on a map.

This project draws upon references of the  work by innumerable Raspberry and Ardino enthusiasts online. We have adapted the python libraries as well as calculation logic to put together this project. All the works here license to public domain and anyone is free to copy and modify the codes for their use. We will publish a complete documentation of bills of material, resources, wiring and other reference materials which can be usefule for other students or enthusiasts here.

Below are the useful list of online resources which inspired and provided us guidelines for this project.
